Hi! I am a PhD student at the Texas A&M University. I work at the intersection of scientific high-performance computing, robotics, and computer graphics at [LASR] (https://lasr.tamu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Manoranjan Majji] (https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/majji-manoranjan.html).

I got my Masters degree at TAMU with the LASR and Tensegrity Systems labs under the supervision of Profs. Manoranjan Majji and Robert Skelton.
