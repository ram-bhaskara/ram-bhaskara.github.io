Hi! 

I am a PhD student in Aerospace engineering at the Texas A&M University. I work at the intersection of scientific high-performance computing, robotics, and computer graphics at [LASR](https://lasr.tamu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Manoranjan Majji](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/majji-manoranjan.html).

My dissertation topic is real-time signal processing and state estimation for high-rate sensing using FPGAs. I'm looking for full-time positions in guidance, navigation, and control starting January 2025. Specifically, I'm interested work on hardware/software design for sensing, filtering, and state estimation for autonomous navigation.

I had been a visiting student researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab during the summers of 2023 and 2022. I worked with [Georgios Georgakis](https://ggeorgak11.github.io/) on Sampling Autonomy for Europa Lander ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12414)). I previously worked with [Shehryar Khattak](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/shehryar-khattak/) on benchmarking vehicle velocity estimation and RADAR odometry for offroad autonomy.   

In 2021, I received my Masters degree at TAMU with the LASR and Tensegrity Systems labs under the supervision of Profs. Manoranjan Majji and Robert Skelton.
