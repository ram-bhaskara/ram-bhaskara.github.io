Hi! I am a PhD student in Aerospace engineering at the Texas A&M University. I work at the intersection of scientific high-performance computing, robotics, and computer graphics at [LASR](https://lasr.tamu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Manoranjan Majji](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/majji-manoranjan.html).


I am a visiting student researcher at [Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) with the [NeBula](https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/) group under the supervision of [Dr. Ali-Akbar Agha-Mohammadi](https://aliagha.site/).

I got my Masters degree at TAMU with the LASR and Tensegrity Systems labs under the supervision of Profs. Manoranjan Majji and Robert Skelton.
